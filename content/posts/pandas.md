## Introduction

Pandas is an open-source python data analysis library created by **Wes McKinney** for **quantitative finance** (hence it's name **pandas** from "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods). It was initially released on January 11th, 2008 and continues to be one of the most popular python tools used when handing data sets nowadays.
