## What is Apache Tomcat?

In web development, Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container. It is designed to execute Java servlets and render JavaServer Pages(JSPs) to serve dynamic web content.


### Tomcat is widely used as a web application server for hosting Java-based web applications. 
It provides a **Java Servlet API** implementation and supports the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specifications. Developers can write servlets and JSPs, which are Java-based components, and deploy them on Tomcat for execution. The Spring Framework provides various features and abstractions to simplify web development, and Tomcat can be used as the underlying web server to deploy Spring-based applications.
