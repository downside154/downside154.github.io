## Summary

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning infrastructure resources through software and automated processes, rather than manual processes. It involves using machine-readable configuration files or scripts to define and control the infrastructure, treating it as code. With IaC, infrastructure resources such as networks, compute services, databases, and storage can be defined, managed, and deployed in a standardized, versioned, and parameterized manner.


### Imperative vs Declarative IaC

IaC allows you to define your infrastructure resources in a descriptive model, specifying the desired outcome rather than the specific steps to achieve it. This approach is known as **declarative infrastructure as code**.

There are two main approaches to implementing IaC: **imperative and declarative**,
- **Imperative IaC** involves writing scripts in languages like Bash or PowerShell, where you explicitly state commands to achieve a desired outcome. This approach requires managing the sequence of dependencies, error control, and resource updates.
- **Declarative IaC** involves writing a definition that describes how you want your infrastructure to look. The tooling then figures out how to make that outcome happen by inspecting the current state, comparing it to the target state, and applying the necessary changes.

Infrastructure modules are independent files that contain a set of resources meant to be deployed together. Modules allow you to break complex templates into smaller, more manageable sets of code. They promote reusability and flexibility and help maintain a clear purpose for each module.

### Benefits

Infrastructure as code brings several benefits to organizations:

- **Automation and efficiency:** IaC enables the automation of infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and deployment processes, reducing manual labor and improving operational efficiency.
- **Consistency and standardization:** By representing infrastructure as code, teams can ensure that the same configuration is applied consistently across various environments, promoting uniformity and reducing configuration discrepancies.
- **Scalability and flexibility:** IaC allows for easy scaling of infrastructure resources by modifying the underlying code, enabling organizations to adapt to evolving demands and optimize resource allocation.
- **Reproducibility and version control:** Treating infrastructure as code enables version control, allowing teams to track changes, collaborate effectively, and easily replicate infrastructure for testing, troubleshooting, and disaster recovery efforts.
- **Documentation and collaboration:** Infrastructure code serves as self-documentation, providing a clear understanding of the infrastructure setup and facilitating collaboration between developers and operations teams.

### Popular IaC Tools 
1. **Terraform:** Terraform is a widely adopted open-source tool for infrastructure as code orchestration. It supports multiple cloud service providers and uses a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure resources.
2. **AWS CloudFormation:** CloudFormation is a popular cloud infrastructure automation tool provided by AWS. It allows you to create, deploy, and manage AWS resources using templates written in YAML or JSON.
3. **Chef:** Chef is a widely used infrastructure as code tool that uses "recipes" and "cookbooks" written in a Ruby-based Domain Specific Language (DSL). It supports multiple cloud providers and offers flexibility in managing infrastructure resources.
4. **Ansible**: Ansible is an open-source automation tool that can be used for infrastructure as code. It uses a simple YAML syntax to define infrastructure configurations and supports a wide range of platforms and cloud providers.
5. **Puppet:** Puppet is a model-driven infrastructure as code tool that uses a client-server architecture. It offers scalability and availability and has a large community and ecosystem of modules.
6. **Pulumi:** Pulumi is a multi-language and multi-cloud development platform that allows you to create and deploy infrastructure as code using languages like TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, and JavaYAML. It supports various cloud providers and offers a unified programming model.
